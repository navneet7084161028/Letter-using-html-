		<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
		<p>Dear Eileen</p>
		<p>Thank you for your application to join us as the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one,in the following sections.</p>

		<h4>Startings dates</h4>
		<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suits us better if you could starts at the beginning of a semester; the dates for each one are as follows: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>First Semester: 9 September 2016 </li>
			<li>Second Semester: 15 January 2017</li>
			<li>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which star due you would prefer.</p>
		<p>You can find more information about<a href="#">important university dates</a> on your websites</p>
		<h4>Subjects of study</h4>
		<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded reaserch facility &#x2212; as long as sunjects fail somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated reseachers, and just the kind pf person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Turning H<sub>2o</sub> in to wine, and health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
			<li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 30&#x2103; (86&#8457;), when the audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3X10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3X10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
			<li><abbr title="Hyper Link Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd except the research to take, required to take, required staff and others resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.  </p>
		<h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
		<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study<i>exotic</i> tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
			<dd>A little known but <i>every</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to courage their livestock to be "fruitful".</dd>
			<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
			<dd>Before thye Icelandic developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together ina circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students uesd to say that he bought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</dd>
			<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
			<dd>An interestings example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960<small>s</small> believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotics", stiled movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they wre just moving like this beacuse they were really cold.</dd>

		<p>Yours sincerely</p>
